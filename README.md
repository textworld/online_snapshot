## Background

I want a tool that can help me snapshot the web page and manage these snapshots. So I took a half day to develop this simple project. This is just for fun because i know it will take a lot of time to build a perfect tool. If no perfect tool can be found, maybe I will continue to develop this project.  

## Install

You need to download the chrome driver from [https://chromedriver.chromium.org/](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/).  The version of chrome driver should match the version of Chrome which you can find by typing `chrome://settings/help` in the address line in Chrome.

Then change the CHROME_DRIVE to the path you put the chrome driver in the `autosnap/settings.py`.

```python
CHROME_DRIVE = r"/Users/textworld/bin/chromedriver" # the bottom of file
```

Next, you need install Django(>=3.0.2). Google it if you don't know how.

## Usage

After you run server, there are 3 pages in this website.

![index-page](index.png)

![list-page](list.png)

![detail-page](detail.png)

First paste the url in the index page. Then click the submit button and wait for a few seconds. Then the browser will navigate you to the detail page. You will see the title, the url and an snapshot image.
